# Complex-Data-Management

The projects I did for my undergraduate course of [Complex Data Management](https://www.cs.uoi.gr/course/complex-data-management/?lang=en). 

Summary of the projects:

### 1) database_operators

* O(n) time for database merge operations such as join, intersection etc between two sorted arrays.

### 2) R_tree

* Implementation of the R-tree data stracture for spatial data (or multi-dimensional data), as well as range and K Nearest Neighbors queries based on R-tree.

### 3) spatial_networks

* Implementation of spatial network algorithms such as Dijkstra and A*, and top-K queries.

### 4) dataset_retrieval

* Containment and relevance retrieval queries between transactions and items.
